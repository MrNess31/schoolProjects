This file explains the utility of each other file in this project.


Graph.java   Vertex.java   Edge.java   Node.java
    These files contain the classes used to make the programs work.


Main.java
    This file contains the algorithms used to answer the questions. 
    Uncomment the adress of the file used to store a network at the 
    top of the page. 
    Uncomment the part you want to test in the main function:
    - Question 1.1 and 1.2: choose the value t1 (1 for question 1.1, 
      2 for question 1.2, or any other value)
    - Question 1.3: choose the values t1 and t2 (1 and 2 for 
      question 1.3, or any other value)
    - Question B.6: this computes the approximate reach of 1000 vertices 
      in the network.This may take quite some time... Replace 1000 by a 
      smaller number if you feel like it.

Visualization:

in the vis/ folder, open vis.html in a browser to visualize the points 
returned by Question 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3. The points.js file contains the points 
to visualize.
